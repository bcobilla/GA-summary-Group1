## Important Events & Announcements

### SRA Retention (presented by Ma’am Michelle Elija Santos)
Students were reminded to take the SRA requirement seriously and to aim to complete as much of it as possible during their first year. The program will now have lesser levels or colors, with the goal of finishing it within two years or four semesters. If that isn’t possible within the given time frame, they may take it during summer or what we call intersession. If not completed by the third year, students may be blocked from enrolling in major subjects.

### CCS Week (presented by Gil Jose Peñaflor)
The CCS week (formerly known as LA’AD), now called Ateneo Arts and Algorithms (Triple A) is currently being finalized. The name was changed from LA’Ad to Triple A to better reflect the integration of artistic perspectives within computer studies. The event is scheduled to take place from October 13-16, 2025. Activities will include TED Talks, a hackathon, a software festival, an esports tournament, and the CCS Night, during which the winners of the previous events will be announced.
